# AboutDialoga

## Description

This lab is a get-to-know WPF, GraphQL and Rest.

## Goals

To learn how to create WPF controls, how to consume GraphQL and Rest requests and how to conform to set code of conduct.
After implementing this dialog in main project, this lab will be expanded to include MVVM with data binding.

## Results

As expected, learning a well-defined set of rules takes time and more effort than just slapping some code together.
(Code was, more-or-less, simple.)
